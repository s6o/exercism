# Algorithms & Problem-solving Test: Sorting

Objective: Implement a merge sort algorithm to sort a list of integers

## Instructions

1. Write a function mergeSort(int[] array) that takes in an array of integers.
2. The function should sort the array using the merge sort algorithm and return the sorted
array.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Correctness and efficiency of the algorithm.
* Proper implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
* Code readability and organization.

## Running example and tests

```sh
dart run example/merge_sort_example.dart
dart run test
```
