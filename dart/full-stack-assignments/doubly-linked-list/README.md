# Data Structures Test: Linked List

Objective: Implement a two-way linked list and perform basic operations.

## Instructions

1. Create a Node class with attributes for storing (integer) data and pointers
   to the next and previous nodes.
2. Create a DoublyLinkedList class that will use the Node class to store data.
3. Implement the following methods in the DoublyLinkedList class:
4. add(int data): Add a new node with the given data at the end of the list.
5. remove(int data): Remove the first node found with the given data.
6. printList(): Print the list data from head to tail.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Correctness of the code.
* Proper usage of the linked list data structure.
* Code readability and organization.

## Running example and tests

```sh
dart run example/doubly_linked_list_example.dart
dart run test
```
