# Full Stack Assignments

This is a set of full-stack developer assigments, orginally for [Java](https://openjdk.org/)
and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

This is to show that getting started with [Dart](https://dart.dev/language) is easy.

Once you know Dart you can dive into building UI applications for desktop,
mobile and web with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev).
