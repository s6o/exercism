# Design Patterns Test: Observer Pattern

Objective: Implement the observer design pattern.

## Instructions

1. Create an interface Observer with a method `update(String message)`.
2. Create a class `Subject` that allows adding and removing observers,
   as well as notifying all observers with a message.
3. Implement a concrete observer class that implements the `Observer` interface.
   This class should print the received message to the console.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Proper implementation of the observer design pattern.
* Correct interaction between the subject and observer.
* Code readability and organization.
